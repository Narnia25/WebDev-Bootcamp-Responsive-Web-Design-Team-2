Heading: French Press
Image Caption: Brewing the Perfect French Press
Paragraphs:
- The French Press is a classic and beloved brewing method known for its simplicity and ability to produce a full-bodied, rich cup of coffee. Unlike paper filters, the French Press uses a metal mesh filter, allowing oils and sediment to pass through, resulting in a more textured mouthfeel and a bolder flavor profile. Its straightforward process makes it an excellent entry point for those new to home brewing.
- The key to a great French Press brew lies in the proper grind size, water temperature, and brewing time. We'll guide you through each step, ensuring you can extract the maximum flavor and aroma from your Express Beans.
- The French Press method also allows you to appreciate the nuances of different coffee origins and roasts. Experiment with our single-origin offerings to discover your personal favorites.
- The French press, also known as a cafetière, press pot, coffee press, or coffee plunger, is a simple coffee brewing device patented by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929. It consists of a narrow cylindrical beaker, usually made of glass or stainless steel, with a plunger/filter assembly that fits tightly inside.

Paragraphs:
- Pour over is a meticulous brewing method that allows for precise control over the brewing process, resulting in a clean and nuanced cup of coffee. By slowly and methodically pouring hot water over coffee grounds, you can extract the full spectrum of flavors and aromas, highlighting the subtle characteristics of your chosen beans.
- Unlike immersion brewing methods like French Press, pour over involves a continuous flow of water through the coffee grounds, requiring a specialized dripper and filter. The Hario V60, Chemex, and Kalita Wave are popular pour over devices, each with its own unique design and characteristics.
- While pour over may seem intimidating at first, with practice, it becomes a rewarding ritual, allowing you to connect with your coffee on a deeper level and appreciate the nuances of each cup. Experiment with different pour over techniques and discover your preferred method for brewing Express Beans.
- The choice of filter also plays a significant role in the final cup. Paper filters produce a cleaner cup by trapping oils and sediment, while cloth filters allow more oils to pass through, resulting in a richer, more textured brew.
