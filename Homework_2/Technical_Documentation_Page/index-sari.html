                <p>Cold brew is a method that produces a smooth, low-acid coffee concentrate by steeping coarsely ground
                    coffee in cold
                    or room temperature water for an extended period. This slow, gentle extraction process minimizes
                    bitterness and
                    highlights the natural sweetness of the beans, resulting in a rich, chocolatey, and incredibly
                    refreshing coffee
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional hot brewing methods, cold brew requires patience, but the reward is a versatile
                    concentrate that
                    can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Enjoy it straight over ice, diluted with
                    water or milk, or use it
                    as a base for delicious coffee cocktails.</p>
                <p>Cold brew's lower acidity makes it a gentler option for those with sensitive stomachs. It also offers
                    a unique flavor
                    profile that differs from hot-brewed coffee, often revealing sweeter, more nuanced notes.</p>
                <p>Experimenting with different Express Beans blends and grind sizes allows you to customize your cold
                    brew experience
                    and discover your perfect balance of flavor and strength. We recommend starting with our signature
                    Espresso Nova blend
                    for a truly exceptional cold brew.</p>
                <code><pre>
                    Important settings:
                    Coffee-to-Water Ratio: 1:8 (adjust for desired concentrate strength)
                    Water Temperature: Room temperature or cold filtered water
                    Brew Time: 12-24 hours (longer steeping times result in a stronger concentrate)
                    Grind Size: Coarse (similar to French Press)
                </pre></code>
                <p>Step-by-step instructions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grind the coffee: Grind your Express Beans coffee to a coarse consistency.</li>
                    <li>Combine coffee and water: In a large container (e.g., a French Press, mason jar, or dedicated
                        cold brew pitcher),
                        combine the ground coffee with cold or room temperature filtered water.</li>
                    <li>Stir gently: Stir the mixture gently to ensure all the grounds are saturated.</li>
                    <li>Steep: Cover the container and let the coffee steep at room temperature or in the refrigerator
                        for 12-24 hours. Longer
                        steeping times will result in a stronger, more concentrated brew.</li>
                    <li>Filter: Once steeping is complete, filter the coffee using a fine-mesh sieve, cheesecloth, or a
                        paper filter. A French
                        press can also be used directly for both steeping and filtering.</li>
                    <li>Store and serve: Store the cold brew concentrate in an airtight container in the refrigerator
                        for up to two weeks.
                        Dilute the concentrate with water or milk to your desired strength and serve over ice.</li>
